## Kirana Project

*What is this? There's already so many DE, why making another one? Isn't it just like reinventing the wheel?*
Well, technically yes, this is reinventing the wheel. But, the purpose making them in Free Pascal since the most DEs are written in C or C++. Customizability is not a priority, if you want to have another look, just modify the source and recompile. The goal is there's no bloated extension manager that runs Javascript or Python codes, make the DE as clean and as lightweight as possible.

**Project Goal:**

The goal is we need to make a functional Desktop Environment made with Free Pascal. I also want to help Pascal programming enthusiasts to grow and not assumed as a dead programming language anymore, that's my wish, I dedicated my project for Mr. Bee (RIP), my teacher who introduced myself to Free Pascal.

**Roadmap:**

1. Desktop
2. Dock Taskbar
3. System Settings
4. File Manager
   * Target: should be integrated with Shell both in Desktop and File Manager
6. Forking FPWM???
7. Wayland???
8. Others

**Dependencies:**
1. Qt5 Widgetset
2. BGRABitmap and BGRAControls
3. Lazarus/LCL
4. Free Pascal/FCL
5. X11
