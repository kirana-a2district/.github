## Kirana Project ðŸ‘‹

*What is this? There's already so many DE, why making another one? Is not this reinventing the wheel?*
Well, technically yes, this is reinventing the wheel. But, the purpose making them in Free Pascal since the most DEs are written in C or C++. Customisability is not a priority, if you want to have another look, just modify the source and recompile.
